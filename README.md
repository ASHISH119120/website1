Internship Details
Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT. LTD.
Name: ASHISH YADAV
Intern ID: CT12WP97
Domain: Ethical Hacking
Internship Duration: 12 Weeks (March 21, 2025 ‚Äì June 21, 2025)
Mentor: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

üìù Task Description
Developed a Python-based File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system to track unauthorized modifications to system files‚Äîan essential component of ethical hacking and digital forensics. The tool uses cryptographic SHA-256 hashing to verify file integrity, stores results in a secure hash database, and alerts users when any tampering or suspicious changes occur. This project demonstrates real-time detection methods used in system hardening and incident response.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language

hashlib: Library for SHA-256 cryptographic hashing

os, json, time: Standard Python modules for file operations, storage, and timestamping

Terminal/Command Prompt: For executing and monitoring script behavior

üìÇ Files Included

file_integrity_monitor.py: Main Python script for hash calculation and integrity checking

config.ini: Configuration file specifying paths to monitor

hash_db.json: Stores the original hashes for each file

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Prepare a config.ini file with the file paths you want to monitor.

Run the script using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python file_integrity_monitor.py
The script will generate or compare hash values and report any unauthorized file changes.
